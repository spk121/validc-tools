FNVTEST PROGRAM MANUAL
=====================

NAME
    fnvtest - Compute FNV-1a hash and track file changes

SYNOPSIS
    fnvtest [OPTIONS] FILENAME

DESCRIPTION
    The 'fnvtest' program computes the FNV-1a hash of a file and compares it with
    a stored value in 'file_hash.dat'. If the file is new or its hash has changed,
    it updates the database and returns 1; if unchanged, returns 0. Designed for
    C23 environments lacking file timestamp functions.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display this help message and exit.

    FILENAME
        The file to check. Must be a single argument.

FILE FORMAT (file_hash.dat)
    Each line contains three columns:
    - "filename" (in quotes)
    - FNV-1a hash (8 hexadecimal characters)
    - ISO timestamp (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
    Example:
        "myprog.c" 1a2b3c4d 2025-04-08T12:00:00

EXAMPLES
    fnvtest myprog.c
        Computes FNV-1a, checks/updates file_hash.dat, returns 0 or 1

    fnvtest --help
        Displays usage information

EXIT STATUS
    0   File unchanged (hash matches stored value)
    1   File changed or new (updates file_hash.dat)
    1   Error (e.g., file not found, argument missing)

NOTES
    - Uses FNV-1a, a simple non-cryptographic hash, for C23 compliance.
    - Updates file_hash.dat by rewriting it with the new entry.
    - Integrates with 'batch' for build dependency checks.
    - Timestamps are in ISO 8601 format using local time.
