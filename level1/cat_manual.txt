CAT PROGRAM MANUAL
==================

NAME
    cat - Concatenate and print files to stdout

SYNOPSIS
    cat [OPTIONS] [FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The 'cat' program reads one or more files and prints their contents to
    standard output in sequence. If no files are specified, it reads from
    stdin. It is designed for use in a C23-compliant development toolkit.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display this help message and exit.

    FILE
        Zero or more files to concatenate. Use '-' to read from stdin explicitly.
        If no files are given, reads from stdin.

EXAMPLES
    cat file.txt
        Prints the contents of file.txt

    cat file1.txt file2.txt
        Prints file1.txt followed by file2.txt

    cat
        Reads from stdin until EOF (e.g., Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z) and echoes it

    cat file.txt -
        Prints file.txt, then reads from stdin

    cat --help
        Displays usage information

EXIT STATUS
    0   Successful execution
    1   Error (e.g., file not found or output failure)

NOTES
    - Files are printed in the order specified.
    - Errors (e.g., file not found) are reported to stderr, and processing
      continues with the next file.
    - Designed to integrate with 'batch' scripts and 'ed'-edited files in a
      C23-only environment.
