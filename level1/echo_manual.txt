ECHO PROGRAM MANUAL
===================

NAME
    echo - Print text to stdout

SYNOPSIS
    echo [OPTIONS] [TEXT ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The 'echo' program prints its arguments to standard output, separated by
    spaces, and appends a newline by default. It is designed for use in a
    C23-compliant development toolkit.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display this help message and exit.

    -n
        Do not append a newline after the text.

    TEXT
        Zero or more strings to print. If no text is provided, a single newline
        is printed unless -n is specified.

EXAMPLES
    echo Hello World
        Prints: "Hello World" followed by a newline

    echo -n Hello
        Prints: "Hello" without a newline

    echo
        Prints: a single newline

    echo -n
        Prints: nothing (empty output)

    echo --help
        Displays usage information

EXIT STATUS
    0   Successful execution

NOTES
    - Arguments are separated by a single space in the output.
    - Options must precede text arguments; anything after the first non-option
      is treated as text.
    - Designed to integrate with 'batch' scripts and 'ed'-edited files in a
      C23-only environment.
