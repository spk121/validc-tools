FNVUPDATE PROGRAM MANUAL
=======================

NAME
    fnvupdate - Update file_hash.dat by recomputing FNV-1a hashes

SYNOPSIS
    fnvupdate [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    The 'fnvupdate' program reads 'file_hash.dat', recomputes the FNV-1a hash for
    each listed file, updates entries if the hash has changed, and removes entries
    for files that cannot be opened. Designed for C23 environments to maintain
    file change tracking.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display this help message and exit.

FILE FORMAT (file_hash.dat)
    Each line contains three columns:
    - "filename" (in quotes)
    - FNV-1a hash (8 hexadecimal characters)
    - ISO timestamp (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
    Example:
        "myprog.c" 1a2b3c4d 2025-04-08T12:00:00

EXAMPLES
    fnvupdate
        Updates file_hash.dat based on current file states

    fnvupdate --help
        Displays usage information

EXIT STATUS
    0   Successful execution
    1   Error (e.g., cannot open file_hash.dat)

NOTES
    - Uses FNV-1a, a simple non-cryptographic hash, for C23 compliance.
    - Rewrites file_hash.dat only if changes are detected.
    - Integrates with 'fnvtest' and 'batch' for build dependency management.
    - Timestamps are in ISO 8601 format using local time.
    - Missing files are removed from the database; changed files get updated hashes
      and timestamps.
