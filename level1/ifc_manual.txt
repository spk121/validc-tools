IFC PROGRAM MANUAL
=================

NAME
    ifc - Evaluate a condition and execute a command

SYNOPSIS
    ifc VALUE1 OPERATOR VALUE2 COMMAND [ARGS ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The 'ifc' program compares two numeric values using a specified operator and
    executes a command with optional arguments if the condition is true. Designed
    for C23-compliant scripting with 'batch'.

ARGUMENTS
    VALUE1
        First numeric value (integer).

    OPERATOR
        Comparison operator: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

    VALUE2
        Second numeric value (integer).

    COMMAND [ARGS ...]
        Command and its arguments to execute if the condition is true (passed to system()).

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display this help message and exit.

EXAMPLES
    ifc 1 == 1 echo Match
        Prints "Match" (condition true)

    ifc 0 != 1 gcc -std=c23 -o myprog myprog.c
        Runs "gcc -std=c23 -o myprog myprog.c" (0 != 1 is true)

    ifc 2 > 3 echo Greater
        Does nothing (condition false)

EXIT STATUS
    0   Condition false or command executed successfully
    1   Error (invalid args, operator, command too long, or command failure)

NOTES
    - Values must be valid integers.
    - Command and arguments are concatenated with spaces, up to 1023 characters.
    - Command is executed via system(), inheriting platform-specific behavior.
    - Integrates with 'batch' using {{?}} for conditional logic.
