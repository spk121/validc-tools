sed - stream editor (strict POSIX subset)

Usage:
  sed [-n] [-e script]... [-f scriptfile]... [file ...]

Options:
  -n             Suppress automatic printing of the pattern space
  -e script      Append a script to the set of editing commands
  -f scriptfile  Read editing commands from scriptfile

Addresses:
  - Single address: a line number (1-based), '$' for last line of input, or a BRE address '/re/'.
  - Range: addr1,addr2 applies to all lines from when addr1 matches until addr2 matches (inclusive).

Supported commands:
  p          Print the pattern space
  d          Delete the pattern space; start the next cycle
  q          Quit immediately (default prints apply to current line)
  n          If auto-print is on, print; then read next line and start next cycle
  =          Print the current line number
  s/RE/REP/[flags]
             Substitute using BRE (\1..\9 in REP). Flags: g (global), p (print on change),
             number (replace that occurrence), w file (write result to file)
  y/src/dst/ Transliterate characters in src to corresponding characters in dst (equal length)
  w file     Write the pattern space to file (file is truncated on first write)
  r file     Append contents of file to output (after current line)
  a\         Append text (next script line(s), '\' at end continues)
  i\         Insert text before current line
  c\         Replace pattern space by text
  N          Append next input line to the pattern space (with a newline)
  D          Delete up to first embedded newline; if none, act like d
  P          Print up to first embedded newline
  h          Copy pattern space to hold space
  H          Append pattern space to hold space
  g          Copy hold space to pattern space
  G          Append hold space to pattern space
  x          Exchange pattern and hold space
  l          Print pattern space in a visible form, ending with '$'

Notes:
- BREs are implemented by the built-in module (., *, ^, $, bracket classes, and \(...\) groups).
- No GNU/BSD extensions are supported (no -i, -r/-E, -z, -s, labels/branches, or multi-file editing).
- For a/i/c, the next script line(s) are taken as text. A trailing '\' continues onto the next script line and inserts a literal newline.
- Default printing: unless -n is given or commands delete/replace early, the (possibly modified) pattern space is printed at the end of each cycle.
