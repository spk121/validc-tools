# validc-tools
A userspace of tools that only uses functions in the C standard.

** Bootstrap, kinda

As part of this thought experiment, you can imagine the tools
were created in this order.

*** led - a line editor

This is a basic line editor.

*** run - a command runner

This is the first build tool. It just reads lines
from a text file and passes them to the system for execution.
